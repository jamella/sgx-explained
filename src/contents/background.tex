\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This section attempts to present the architectural context around Intel's SGX,
because analyzing the security of SGX requires understanding the interactions
between all the parts of an enclave's execution environment. Unless specified
otherwise, the information here is summarized from Intel's
\textit{Software Development Manual} (SDM) \cite{intel2015sdm}.

Each of the sub-sections below explains how its information is relevant to
to SGX, but does not introduce any SGX concepts. Readers familiar with x86's
intricacies can safely skip this section and refer back when necessary.

We use the term \textit{Intel processor} and \textit{Intel CPU} to refer to the
server and desktop versions of Intel's Core line-up, as we focus on the SGX
design's most likely targets. This writing is not interested in Intel's other
processors, such as the embedded line of Atom CPUs, or the failed Itanium line.
Consequently, the terms \textit{Intel computers} and \textit{Intel systems}
refers to computer systems built around Intel's Core processors.

In this paper, the term \textit{Intel architecture} refers to the x86
architecture described in Intel's SDM. The x86 architecture is overly complex,
mostly due to the need to support execute legacy software dating back to 1990
directly on the CPU, without the overhead of software interpretation. In the
interest of space and mental sanity, we only cover the parts of the
architecture visible to modern 64-bit software.

The 64-bit version of the x86 archicture, covered in this section, was actually
invented by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and is also known as AMD64,
\texttt{x86\_64}, and x64. The term ``Intel architecture'' highlights our
interest in the architecture's implementation in Intel's chips, and our desire
to understand the mindsets of Intel SGX's designers.
