\label{sec:background}

Arguing about the security of an application running on an mainstream computer
using the Intel architecture requires understanding the interactions between
all the parts of an x86 execution environment. This section provides an
overview of the features referenced by the rest of the paper. Unless specified
otherwise, the information in this section can be found in Intel's
\textit{Software Development Manual} \cite{intel2015sdm} (SDM).

Each of the sub-sections below explains how its information is relevant to
to SGX, but does not introduce any SGX concepts. Experienced readers can safely
skip this section and refer back if necessary.
