Secure remote computation (Figure~\ref{fig:remote_computation}) is the problem
of executing software on a remote computer \textbf{owned and maintained by an
untrusted party}, with some integrity and privacy guarantees. In the general
setting, secure remote computation is an unsolved problem. Fully Homomorphic
Encryption \cite{gentry2009fhe} solves the problem for a limited family of
computations, but has an impractical performance overhead
\cite{naehrig2011can}.
