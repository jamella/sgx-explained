This work discusses the original version of SGX, also referred to as SGX 1.
While SGX 2 brings very useful improvements for enclave authors, it is a small
incremental improvement, from a design and implementation standpoint. After
understanding the principles behind SGX 1 and its security properties, the
reader should be well equipped to face Intel's reference documentation and
learn about the changes brought by SGX 2.
