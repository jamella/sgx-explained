\section{Security Background}
\label{sec:security_background}

The attacks that can be performed on a computer system are broadly classified
into physical attacks and software attacks. In \textit{physical attacks}, the
attacker takes advantage of a system's physical implementation detail to
perform an operation that bypasses the limitations set by the computer
system's software abstraction layers. In contrast, \textit{software attacks}
are performed solely by interacting with the victim computer via software
means. \S~\ref{sec:physical_attacks} summarizes the main types of physical
attacks.

The distinction between software and physical attacks is particularly relevant
in cloud computing scenario, where gaining software access to the computer
running a victim's software can be accomplished with a credit card backed by
modest funds~\cite{ristenpart2009colocation}, whereas physical access is a
harder prospect, requiring trespass, coercion, or social engineering on the
cloud provider's employees.

However, the distinction between software and physical attacks is blurred by
the attacks presented in \S~\ref{sec:device_attacks}, which exploit
programmable peripherals connected to the victim computer's bus in order to
carry out actions that are normally associated with physical attacks.
