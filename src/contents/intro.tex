\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is the latest iteration in a long line
of designs that aim to offer the ability of executing software on a computer
owned by an untrusted party, while at the same time providing some guarantees
about the privacy and integrity of the computation.

SGX implements a \textit{remote attestation model} similar to its predecessors,
TPM~\cite{tpm} and TXT~\cite{grawrock2009txt}. A system that is not under the
computation owner's control, with an SGX-enabled processor, produces an
attestation promising to the computation owner that a message was produced in a
protected environment. The attestation includes a cryptographic hash
(called \textit{measurement} in the Intel documentation) used by the
computation owner to verify the protected environment, including the code and
data loaded in the environment and the memory layout.
