\section{SGX Programming Model}

The central concept of SGX is the \textit{enclave}, a protected environment
that contains the code and data pertaining to a security-sensitive computation.
SGX-enabled processors provide trusted computing by isolating each enclave's
environment from the untrusted software outside the enclave, and by
implementing a software attestation scheme that allows a remote party to
authenticate the software running inside an enclave. SGX's isolation mechanisms
are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of the computation performed
inside an enclave from attacks coming from malicious software executing on the
same computer, as well as from a limited set of physical attacks.

This section summarizes the SGX concepts that make up a mental model which is
sufficient for programmers to author SGX enclaves and to add SGX support to
existing system software. All the information in this section is backed up by
Intel's Software Developer Manual (SDM). Future sections use the model created
here to fill in some the missing pieces in the manual, namely a description of
the SGX implementation and an anlysis of SGX's security properties.
