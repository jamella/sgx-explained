\section{Conclusion}

Shortly after authors we found out about Intel's Software Guard Extensions
(SGX) initiative, we set out to study it in the hope of finding a practical
solution to its vulnerability to cache timing attacks. After reading the
official SGX manuals, we were left with more questions than when we started.
The SGX patents filled some of the gaps in the official documentation, but also
revealed Intel's enclave licensing scheme, which has troubling implications.

After learning about the SGX implementation and inferring its design
constraints, we discarded our draft proposals for defending enclave software
against cache timing attacks. We concluded that it would be impossible to claim
to provide this kind of guarantee given the design constraints and all the
unknowns surrounding the SGX implementation. Instead, we applied the knowledge
that we gained to design Sanctum~\cite{costan2015sanctum}, which is briefly
described in \S~\ref{sec:related_sanctum}

This paper describes our findings while studying SGX. We hope that it will help
fellow researches understand the breadth of issues that need to be considered
before accepting a trusted hardware design as secure. We also hope that our
work will prompt the research community to expect more openness from the
vendors who ask us to trust their hardware.
